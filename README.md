# Code exercise: Ten Pin Bowling scoring.

This is a code exercise.

## Prerequisites

### Runtime
- JDK 8
- Maven 3+

### IDE
(Only choose one)
- IntelliJ IDEA 14+ (Choose .iml file or import pom.xml)
- Eclipse (import pom.xml)

## Functional requirements

Write a java application that takes a string of space separated numbers from 0 to 10 and calculates what that would be as a score in ten pin bowling (hints on how to score in bowling are here: http://www.bowling2u.com/trivia/game/scoring.asp).  

If a final score cannot be determined from the input then method should return the "current" score (i.e. assumes any remaining bowls scored 0).  

Include unit tests and post code to a publicly accessible code repository.

Example inputs and outputs
```
"1 2 3 4" -> 10
"9 1 9 1" -> 29
"1 1 1 1 10 1 1" -> 18
"10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10" -> 300
```
## Technical requirements

- The code works (we will be going beyond the 4 examples bowls provided)
- It's tested (We will be looking at the extensiveness of their testing)
- Classes and methods are logically structured (please make it as easy to understand the code as possible) (Comments may be useful but we don't judge on this)
- They meet all the requirements

Also:
- Use of OO principles (Encapsulation, Polymorphism, Abstraction etc)
- Coupling and cohesion (These are not desired, including temporal coupling)
- Input validation
- Separation of concerns
- Appropriate use of access modifiers
- Superfluous code (Code which adds or does nothing for the solution is not desired)

# Reference game simulation

To verify the scores, refer to the website http://bit.ly/2kVCSTk.

# Build and run

To build and execute all tests with Maven 3, invoke:
```
mvn clean install
```
To run the application in CLI, invoke:
```
mvn exec:java -Dexec.args=" \"{arguments}\" "
```
For example, to run with argument "1 2 3 4", the command must be:
```
mvn exec:java -Dexec.args=" \"1 2 3 4\" "
```
